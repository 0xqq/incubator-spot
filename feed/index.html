				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The “first” documented cybersecurity case was the worm replication, which was initiated by Robert T. Morris on November 2, 1988. Wow! Here we are in 2016, 28 years later, with viruses and worms giving way to Trojan horses and polymorphic code. Nowadays, we are also fighting against DDoS, phishing, spear phishing attacks, command and controls along with APTs such as Aurora, Zeus, Red October and Stuxnet. What happened with our security controls on each attack?</p>
<p>Despite heroic efforts, internal and external security controls, no matter if they are preventive, detective or corrective, can be bypassed by different situations or misconfigurations. Capabilities to detect bugs or vulnerabilities in code, protocol, etc. are still limited. When we consider how to close these gaps, we have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect information from each device that is part of the environment.</li>
<li>Collect information from the critical infrastructure that is used for most, if not all, of the systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>This blog will describe the second approach.</p>
<p>Critical infrastructure, including nationally significant infrastructure, can be broadly defined as the systems, assets, facilities and networks that provide essential services. For nations, this means protecting the national security, economic security and prosperity as well as the health and safety of their citizenry. If we extrapolate this definition on the IT enterprise environments, we can define the critical infrastructure as the service, or services, that need to be up and running properly 99.99999% of the time, most of the time to support other critical infrastructure, such as databases, HR systems, manufacturing systems, etc.</p>
<p>Effectively protecting critical infrastructure means that millions, if not billions, of different scenarios must be identified and monitored. To do this, the cybersecurity problem must be broken into small pieces.</p>
<p>Let’s consider DNS — your communications to the Web. How can you know which communications are being established by your critical servers? And, what if you want to do it for most of your infrastructure?</p>
<p>First idea: Use NetFlow, which is a network protocol that helps us collect IP traffic information and monitor network traffic. NetFlow has the details on the communications of all of your network traffic. However, the normal data on an enterprise environment includes billions of NetFlow events per day. To use this data to identify issues, it must be stored and analyzed. Storage alone is costly. Analyzing what amount Big Data stores is an entire other challenge.</p>
<p>Apache Spot offers a solution. It was designed to gather, store and analyze Big Data. In fact, Apache Spot is an ideal solution for this cybersecurity challenge. Apache Spot can integrate many different data sources in a data lake then add operational context to the data by linking configuration, inventory, service databases and other data stores. This helps you to prioritize the actions to take under different attack, malware, APT and hacking scenarios. With Apache Spot, attacks that bypass our external or internal security controls can be identified. By delivering risk-prioritized, actionable insights, Apache Spot can support the growing need for security analytics.</p>
<p>Not only can Apache Spot collect, store and analyze billions of NetFlow packets, but it can also be adapted to meet the unique requirements of your organization. How? Apache Spot is an open-source project.</p>
<p><strong>But Wait, There’s More</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About four years ago, the era of the Big Data analytics began. Paired with advanced analytics, massive volumes of data can be culled to not only inform critical decisions, but also to simulate sophisticated “what if” scenarios that allow companies to gain competitive advantages by generating and predicting different scenarios. For example, a financial services company can more accurately determine what other products to offer a customer, and in what order, based on a wide variety of data, then use advanced analytics to gather insights. Creating a data lake that can be effectively used for predictive analytics raises tough questions — what data sources should we use?  How should this data be collected and ingested? What are the best algorithms to analyze the data, and how should we present these results to our decision maker?</p>
<p>Apache Spot can help to solve most of these issues. Following is a description of the Apache Spot, which is designed to facilitate Big Data analytics scenarios like the financial services company’s question about the right product to offer customers.</p>
<a href="http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ONI_Architecture-Diagram_1300_v4.png"><img src="http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ONI_Architecture-Diagram_1300_v4.png" alt="oni_architecture-diagram_1300_v4" width="1300" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114" srcset="http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ONI_Architecture-Diagram_1300_v4.png 1300w, http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ONI_Architecture-Diagram_1300_v4-300x156.png 300w, http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ONI_Architecture-Diagram_1300_v4-768x399.png 768w, http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ONI_Architecture-Diagram_1300_v4-1024x532.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></a>
<h3><strong>Apache Spot Core Components</strong></h3>
<p>The Apache Spot Core is composed of three main components — data integration (collectors), data store (HDFS here, but can also be a non-SQL database) and machine learning.</p>
<p>In this diagram, the top left shows Apache Spot Data Sources, which include the collection of the information that will be used to create a data lake. The process is simple. Define a pull or push from the source of information then capture this information on Apache Spot’s “collectors.” The collectors are processes that interpret the information that is sent, then write it to the HDFS system in the Apache Spot cluster. The HDFS stores the data lake and ensures that resources can grow while remaining economical at every size. The Apache Spot algorithms are part of machine learning and are used to detect the uncommon information in the data lake.</p>
<h3><strong>Operational Analytics</strong></h3>
<p>As part of operational analytics, Apache Spot executes different batch processes that add information to machine learning results to provide meaning and context. Using the financial services product example, basic customer data could be augmented with information about other customers in the same region along with information about which products those customers recommended or complained about. Basically, the data scientists can “play” with the data using different algorithms to identify insights.</p>
<h3><strong>Visualizing Results</strong></h3>
<p>The Apache Spot GUI displays the results that the machine learning algorithms generate. Results are represented such that it is easy to identify both the most common things as well as find the most suspicious or uncommon information that is part of the data lake.</p>
<h3><strong>Customizable Open Source</strong></h3>
<p>Because Apache Spot is an open-source project, most of the components depicted here can be modified by the end user.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While this is not the first blog post about Apache Spot, it is the first one by a creator of the solution. As a security data scientist in Intel&#8217;s Data Center Group, I joined a small team to start thinking about solving really hard problems in cloud analytics. The team grew, and out of that effort, came Apache Spot. Since we started talking about the project, these are the three questions I am asked the most.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Apache Spot?</strong><br />
Apache Spot is an open source, flow and packet analytics solution built on Hadoop. It combines big data processing, at-scale machine learning, and unique security analytics to put potential threats in front of defenders. While I am a data scientist today, I was a security investigator just a few years ago. I wanted to develop a solution that would put new tools and technology in play for defenders, but without requiring them to walk away from security and get a math degree.</p>
<p>We wanted to start with the hard problems, so we looked at the emerging need to analyze data that was produced at a scale outside what a lot of security solutions could handle. The data is being created today, and lack of visibility into that data gives attackers a profound advantage. Also, in this new era of security, many defenders (public and private sector) have to answer to their citizens and customers when these threats occur. In other words, an event that says &#8220;this attack was blocked&#8221; is insufficient; an organization needs to see what happened before, during, and after a particular machine was attacked at a particular time. The problem is summarized in a slide from a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOZjMuBLYyM" target="_blank">FloCon talk</a><br />
<a href="http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FloCon2015.png" rel="attachment wp-att-66"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-66" src="http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FloCon2015.png" alt="open source packet and flow analytics" width="960" height="720" srcset="http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FloCon2015.png 960w, http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FloCon2015-300x225.png 300w, http://spot.incubator.apache.org//wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FloCon2015-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<p>The gist is that while processing is a challenge at higher scales, the amount of insight gained is higher when analyzing flows and packets from key protocols (like DNS). And that&#8217;s how we got here.</p>
<p><strong>Why Intel?</strong></p>
<p>At Intel, I have worked in IT, for a security product company (McAfee), and in the Data Center Group. Intel IT was an early pioneer of the concept of proactive investigations to protect intellectual property. McAfee (now Intel Security Group) has a broad customer base in the realms of network, endpoint, and content security, to name only a few. And the Intel Data Center group has strategic partnerships with Cloudera and Accenture, as well as some pretty cool analytics efforts of their own. Add the performance benefits we achieve with Intel Architecture, especially the Intel MPI Library and Intel Math Kernel Library, and it certainly makes sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>Why Open Source?</strong></p>
<p>I learned from my earlier efforts in security analytics, that to invite collaboration from academia, the public sector, and the private sector, open source software is an excellent choice. We are now seeking to build a community of developers, data scientists, and security enthusiasts to grow Apache Spot into something we can all be proud of. We have also chosen an Apache software license, so that it can enrich commercial software offerings as well.</p>
<p>The greatest thing for me since we announced at RSA is to hear OTHER people talk about Apache Spot (formerly Open Network Insight or ONI), here are some of my favorites, from <a href="http://vision.cloudera.com/open-network-insight-changing-infosec-data-science-forever/" target="_blank">a Data Scientist @ eBay </a>, <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-introduces-the-accenture-cyber-intelligence-platform-to-help-organizations-continuously-predict-detect-and-combat-cyber-attacks.htm" target="_blank">a Security Provider</a>, and <a href="http://vision.cloudera.com/adaptive-security-at-big-data-scale-for-next-generation-digital-security/" target="_blank">a Big Data company</a>.</p>
