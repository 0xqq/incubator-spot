                                        By Rob Kent, Vice President of Marketing at Cybraics Competition is widely considered to be a healthy and positive thing, traditionally viewed as providing options for customers and fueling innovation. In the world of cybersecurity there is no shortage of competition, in fact cybersecurity is one of the most crowded and fast-growing areas of technology&#8230;. <a class="excerpt-read-more" href="strength-in-numbers-why-consider-open-source-cybersecurity-analytics/" title="Read Strength in Numbers:  Why Consider Open Source Cybersecurity Analytics">Read more &raquo;</a>

This means that data scientists and developers need to be able to query and handle the source data to find all the information they need for their decision making.

                                        The “first” documented cybersecurity case was the worm replication, which was initiated by Robert T. Morris on November 2, 1988. Wow! Here we are in 2016, 28 years later, with viruses and worms giving way to Trojan horses and polymorphic code. Nowadays, we are also fighting against DDoS, phishing, spear phishing attacks, command and controls&#8230; <a class="excerpt-read-more" href="apache-spot-and-cybersecurity-using-netflows-to-detect-threats-to-critical-infrastructure/" title="Read Apache Spot and Cybersecurity — Using NetFlows to Detect Threats to  Critical Infrastructure">Read more &raquo;</a>

                                        About four years ago, the era of the Big Data analytics began. Paired with advanced analytics, massive volumes of data can be culled to not only inform critical decisions, but also to simulate sophisticated “what if” scenarios that allow companies to gain competitive advantages by generating and predicting different scenarios.

As a security data scientist in Intel&#8217;s Data Center Group, I joined a small team to start thinking about solving really hard problems in cloud analytics. The team grew, and out of that&#8230; <a class="excerpt-read-more" href="apache-spot-3-most-asked-questions/" title="Read Apache Spot: Three Most-Asked Questions">Read more &raquo;</a>
